# SQL Layoffs Analysis Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes layoff trends across industries, companies, and countries using a dataset of 2361 layoff events from 2020 to 2023.

## Goals
- Analyze layoff trends from 2020 to 2023 to identify patterns across industries, companies, and countries.
- Clean and preprocess a raw dataset of 2,361 records to ensure data quality for reliable insights.
- Provide actionable insights through SQL-based exploration and analysis, focusing on yearly, monthly, and industry impacts.
- Document the workflow and findings to serve as a reusable template for similar data projects.

## File Structure
- `Data Exploration.sql`: Initial exploration of the dataset.
- `Data Cleaning.sql`: Cleaning steps to handle NULLs, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- `Data Analysis.sql`: Queries for trend analysis (yearly, monthly, etc.).
- `layoffs.csv`: The original dirty dataset (2,361 rows with NULLs).
- `cleaned_layoffs.csv`: The cleaned dataset (after cleaning and duplicate removal).
